# Game-Scoreboard-Sample

A sample google appscript for formatting google form submissions. 

The google form uploads the following information to the main sheet. These are, from left to right in columns:
Timestamp	
hat is your full name?	
What is your discord username?	
What is your age? 	
What is your score?	
Upload a screenshot of your score	
Any short comments you would like to make?	
Which version of Tetris are you using. (There are two possible options for this: Classical and Other)

The program will filter through the options, uploading information to the "classical" or "other" sheet  depending on the answer to the last question. 
The program also does not upload the screenshot link to the final classical or other sheet. 
The main sheet is not designed to be visible, which is why formatting is only done on the "classical" or "other" sheet. 

The program also contains some formatting features, such as headings, as well as an auto sorting feature, and color coding top 3 winners. 

This was my first expierence with google appscript and also a new expierence with javascript, so apologies in advance for violating any other conventions. 

Hope you foudn this useful!
